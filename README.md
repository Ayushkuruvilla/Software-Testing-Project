# Software-Testing-Project

Setting up a virtual environment to run the scripts in this project:

1. Make sure you have python version 3.11 installed, if not install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/
2. Install the pipenv package, can be done with:
``` pip install pipenv ```
3. Run the command:
``` pipenv shell ```
If this doesn't work because your machine can't find the python installation on your system, use:
``` pipenv --python '/path/to/your/python' shell ```
4. Run:
``` pipenv install ```
5. Now you should have a virtual environment active on your terminal that you can use to run the scripts, containing the required dependencies!
